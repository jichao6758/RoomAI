### TexasHoldEm Poker


SevenKing_Five_Two_Three is a poker game in the Chinese [Wikipedia](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/7%E9%AC%BC523).


In SevenKing, we use the class roomai.sevenking.SevenKingPokerCard as the poker card. Note: we extend roomai.common.PokerCard by implementing roomai.sevenking.SevenKingPokerCard, since the rank of suit in SevenKing is different from that in general.
The poker card has the point (2, 3, A for example) and suit(Spade, Heart, Club and Diamond). There is a special suit (ForKing) for the r and R point.

The basic usage is as follows:
<pre>
>>> import roomai.sevenking
>>> poker_card = roomai.sevenking.SevenKingPokerCard.lookup("A_Spade")
>>> poker_card.point_str
'A'
>>> poker_card.point_rank
8
>>> poker_card.suit_str
"Spade"
>>> poker_card.suit_rank
3
>>> poker_card.key
"A_Spade"
>>> poker_card1 = roomai.sevenking.SevenKingPokerCard.lookup("r_ForKing")
>>> poker_card1.key
"r_ForKing"
>>> poker_card1.suit_rank
4
</pre>


In SevenKing, the action is consisted of poker cards. The basic usage is as follows:
<pre>
>>> action = roomai.sevenking.SevenKingAction.lookup("3_Spade,3_Heart")
>>> action.key
"3_Spade,3_Heart"
>>> action.pattern
"p_2"
>>> action = roomai.sevenking.SevenKingAction.lookup("")
>>> action.key
""
>>> action.pattern
"p_0"
</pre>
The "" action is special action, since it contains no poker card. This action is considered as "fold" in SevenKing


The structures of Public_State and Person_State in SevenKing are as follows. All attributes in Public_State and Person_State are None by default.
