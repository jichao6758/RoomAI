### Five Card Stud

Five Card Stud is the earliest form of the card game stud poker, originating during the American Civil War, but is less commonly played today than many other more popular poker games.
It is still a popular game in parts of the world, especially in Finland where a specific variant of five-card stud called Sökö (also known as Canadian stud or Scandinavian stud) is played.
The word sökö is also used for checking in Finland ("I check" = "minä sökötän"). You can see details of Five Card Stud in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-card_stud).

In Five Card Stud, the action has two parts: option (action type) and price (count of chips). The option has six types: Fold, Check, Call, Raise, Bet
and Showhand. The prices for Fold must be zero. The basic usage is as follows:
<pre>
>> action = roomai.fivecardstud.FiveCardStudAction.lookup("Fold_0")
>> action.option
"Fold"
>> action.price
0
>> action.key()
"Fold_0"
</pre>

In SevenKing, we use the class roomai.fivecardstud.FiveCardStudPokerCard as the poker card. Note: we extend roomai.common.PokerCard by implementing roomai.fivecardstud.FiveCardStudPokerCard, since the rank of suit in FiveCardStud is different from that in general.
The poker card has the point (2, 3, A for example) and suit(Spade, Heart, Club and Diamond). There is a special suit (ForKing) for the r and R point.
The basic usage is as follows:
<pre>
>>> import roomai.fivecardstud
>>> poker_card = roomai.fivecardstud.FiveCardStudPoker("A_Spade")
>>> poker_card.point_str
'A'
>>> poker_card.point_rank
8
>>> poker_card.suit_str
"Spade"
>>> poker_card.suit_rank
0
>>> poker_card.key()
"A_Spade"
>>>
</pre>
